LMGTFY-fy.

I get it. You're lazy.

Your friend just asked you a stupid question but instead of actually answering it, you want to throw them a Google link.

You know about the site lmgtfy. But, wow, is it ever a ton of extra work to go to that site, type in your search term, and then get the link to use to troll your friend with.

I know, friend. I know exactly how you feel.

Using the LMGTFY-fy extension, you can use a Chrome extension to type in the search terms and generate a lmgtfy link without having to even leave your current tab.

Want to mask your trolly lmgtfy link with an URL shortener? Look no further, we've got that too!

Enjoy!
